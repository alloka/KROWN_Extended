# KROWN ðŸ‘‘: A Benchmark for RDF Graph Materialization

KROWN (Knowledge gRaph cOnstruction beNchmark) is a benchmark for 
materialization systems to construct Knowledge Graphs from 
(semi-)heterogeneous data sources using declarative mappings
such as [RML](http://w3id.org/rml/portal).

Many benchmarks already exist for virtualization systems
e.g. [GTFS-Madrid-Bench](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench),
[NPD](https://ontop-vkg.org/npd-benchmark/),
[BSBM](http://wbsg.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/)
which focus on complex queries with a single declarative mapping.
However, materialization systems are unaffected
by complex queries since their input is the dataset and the mappings to
generate a Knowledge Graph. Some specialized datasets exist to benchmark
specific limitations of materialization systems such as duplicated or empty
values in datasets e.g. [GENOMICS](https://doi.org/10.57702/4c9ivpgs), 
but they do not cover all aspects of materialization systems.
Therefore, it is hard to compare materialization systems
among each other in general which is where KROWN comes in!

## Data generator

KROWN provides a data generator to scale the different benchmark scenarios
with multiple scaling parameters, configurable through a set of 
JSON configuration files. This way, any combination can be used of scaling
parameters and their values are stored to easily reproduce 
the generation in the future.

KROWN's data generator is available inside
the [data-generator](./data-generator) folder consisting of scenarios under [data-generator/config](./data-generator/config)
and unittests to verify the output of the generator ([data-generator/tests](./data-generator/tests)].
More information can be found in the [README](data-generator/README.md).

**Example usage**

```
cd data-generator
./exgentool generate --scenario=/path/to/config.json
```

## Execution framework

KROWN provides also an execution framework to reproducible execute benchmark
scenarios as a pipeline of Docker containers while measuring metrics e.g.
execution time, CPU time, memory consumption, storage usage, etc.

KROWN's execution framework is available inside
the [execution-framework](./execution-framework) folder
and unittests to verify the execution of Docker-based pipelines and collection
of metrics by KROWN's execution framework ([execution-framework/tests](./execution-framework/tests)].
More information can be found in the [README](./execution-framework/README.md).

**Example usage**

```
cd execution-framework
./exectool --runs=5 --root=/path/to/scenarios run
```

The execution framework of KROWN has been used in the
[Knowledge Graph Construction Workshop Challenges](https://w3id.org/kg-construct/workshop/2024/challenge.html)
at ESWC 2023 and 2024.
It was also used in benchmarking incremental mappings with
[IncRML (under review)](https://semantic-web-journal.net/content/incrml-incremental-knowledge-graph-construction-heterogeneous-data-sources).

Their status is followed up in a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/kg-construct/projects/2/)
by the Knowledge Graph Construction community.
